    The name of the helper method is "daysInMonth".
    It is used called at line 35 and then in a loop in the
    main method on line 39, based on the numbers of months
    between the start and the end date. The location of the
    method in the original source-fileis on line no. 13.

3.4 - BugReport
    line 13        - The whole daysInMonth method is wrong. No 28 days for februari. Wrong for certain months.
    line 35 and 39 - Both for-loops call daysInMonth starting from 0. There is no month 0 in this case. Should start from 1 or
                     the months should be numbered 0...11 in the helper function months.
    line X         - Missing function for determining if some date is after or before the later date.
