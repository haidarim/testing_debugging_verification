
#1 insertTests
Here we found a bug. It used breaks instead of returns.
The breaks only made it exit the closestested loop which
was the for-loop and not the function. So it always reached
the last add statement.

#2 memberTests
public void isMember() - testing a number that is in the set.
public void notMemberEnd() - testing a number that is not in the set.
public void notMemberMiddle() - testing a number that is not in the set.

The reason we have 2 tests to check that a member is not in the set is to get full
BC. The first one exits thru the last return statement after exiting the loop,
while the second test uses the return statement inside the loop.

#3 intersectTests
This test suit uses only one test case, which tests three things.

public void allIntersect()

First is a non intersecting, which covers the branch to the remove statement.
Then we have a matching number which covers the branch into the statements inside of
the first if-loop. Then we use a number so that the for-loop terminates, covering the path
from the forloop to the end of the method.

#4 distinctClosedTests
public void distinctClosedTrue() - returns true
public void distinctClosedFalse() - returns false
Will give BC
